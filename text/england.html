<h3> What I love most about England</h3>

<ul>
<li> The schools are small, not atheistic, and the students wear uniforms.<br>
<li> I love pounds, they are fun to stack and count.<br>
<li> The women are not all that into dressing up, except in
	knee-high army green wellington boots and fishing jackets.<br>
<li> The accents are delightful (mostly).<br>
<li> I like the trains.<br>
<li> The tap water is always cold enough to drink.<br>
<li> The people appreciate walking (they think that the gravel patch on the
	side of US roads is for walking).<br>
<li> The people appreciate putty (although they call it "blue-tack")<br>
<li> Everyone appreciates the color green (I&rsquo;m particularly fond
        of National Trust green).<br>
<li> They are better at making French bread, and even if they weren&rsquo;t,
        one can easily go to France to get the real thing.<br>
<li> In the summer the sun is up before you wake up til after you go to
        bed (it&rsquo;s easier to get up, and gives you more play time).<br>
<li> They always wear white for proper games (e.g., tennis, cricket,
	stool-ball)<br>
<li> They appreciate cream in all forms (cream, whipping cream, single
	cream, double cream, triple cream, clotted cream, etc.)<br>
<li> The produce is of the highest quality.<br>
<li> They play real football rather than American football.<br>
<li> There are no mosquitoes.<br>
<li> People&rsquo;s gardens are so lovely they can take your breath away.<br>
</ul>

<h3>What I hate most about England</h3>

<ul>
<li> The back wheels on the grocery carts swivel.<br>
<li> The dogs are all ugly.<br>
<li> The closets are all 3 inches too shallow.<br>
<li> The garages are 3 feet too narrow.<br>
<li> Everyone is so pale (especially if they are from Edinburgh&#185).  This is
 	particularly noticeable because everyone loves to wear black.<br>
<li> People drive on the left but they don&rsquo;t always walk on the left.<br>
<li> They don&rsquo;t have hot/cold mixing faucets.<br>
<li> The hot and cold water faucets change orientation (not that this matters
	as the water is always cold).<br>
<li> The bathrooms are not heated.  The coldest thing in England is the
	toilet seat in the men&rsquo;s restroom at the ITRI.<br>
<li> The "pets welcome" list of restaurants is longer than the 
	"children welcome" one.<br>
<li> The beer, like everything else in England, is room temperature.<br>
<li> The sausages are suitable for vegetarians (the Guiness isn&rsquo;t).<br>
<li> Only in England would they make a plunger that is too short to keep
	your hand out of the stool water!<br>
<li> There are no hard flat writing surfaces in England.<br>
<li> The roads are too narrow, and what&rsquo;s worse, the majority of road work
        I have seen involves NARROWING the roads and putting in curbs
        (or "kerbs" as they would have it).<br>
<li> You have to dial slowly!<br>
<li> There are no book drops when the library is open.<br>
<li> Don&rsquo;t get into the water!<br>
<li> Service people (e.g., sales people, librarians, cashiers) always have
	the air of someone doing you a favor which is inconvenient for
	them.<br>
<li> You cannot sneak around in a British house, the floors creak and the 
	light switches are noisy.<br>
<li> I&rsquo;M SICK OF BLOCK CAPITALS (all forms must be filled out with capitals)..<br>
<li> They make horrible ice cream.<br>
</ul>

Edinburgh, given that Scotland is <b>not</b> part of England.</font>
