<h3> What I love most about Australia (Sydney mostly)</h3>

<ul>
<li> The scenery is beautiful (e.g., Sydney harbor, the beaches, the Blue Mountains).
<li> So is the weather.
<li> They have weird animals (e.g., parrots, kangaroos, koalas).
<li> They do great barbecues ("barbies" as they would have it).
<li> You don&rsquo;t need to remember first names - just call everyone "mate" - this works with men, women, children and pets.
<li> They are fiercely egalitarian (e.g., people tend to ride in the front
seats of cabs).
<li> They put coconut in everything.
<li> They have great shower heads.
<li> One of the national TV stations (SBS) features non-Hollywood movies.
<li> They have a slightly naughty sense of humor in their
advertisements: e.g., "We&rsquo;re #1 on #2" (an ad for a waste treatment
company), "we protect your largest organ longer" (an ad for
sunscreen with a picture of naked man holding a bottle of the product
in a strategic location), and "Try freezing your nuts this summer" (an add
for frozen snickers bars).
<li> Primary and Secondary students ride free on public transport.
<li> Crime is lower (e.g., We&rsquo;ve had a number of lost items returned that
would have been long gone in the US or England). 
<li> The seafood is excellent and affordable.
<li> It&rsquo;s thousands of miles from anywhere.
</ul>

<h3>What I hate most about Australia</h3>

<ul>
<li> Sunburn - No one gets a tan, it&rsquo;s a burn or nothing.
<li> You&rsquo;ll eventually be killed by either a poisonous animal or a rip tide (or skin cancer).
<li> Santa shouldn&rsquo;t wear shorts.
<!-- <li> Blundstone boots are disgustingly ugly - Be happy if you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about. -->
<li> They&rsquo;ve reduced all the nouns in the English language to two classes, those ending in "ie" and those ending in "o". Here are some translations:
<ul>
<li> barbie - barbecue
<li> mozzie - mosquito
<li> prezzie - present
<li> garbo - garbage
<li> muso - musician
<li> arvo - afternoon
<li> and so on - ad nauseum<br>
Here are <a href="aussie-slang.html">more from Maria Milosavljevic</a>
</ul>
<li> Cockroaches&#185 (Sydney only I&rsquo;m told)
<li> They put beets on hamburgers.
<li> They have plastic toilet seats.
<li> Corrugated iron is used as a designer building material.
<li> It&rsquo;s thousands of miles from anywhere.
</ul>
